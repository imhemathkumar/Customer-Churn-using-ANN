# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

Predicting customer churn is one of the highest-impact problems in business analytics. This project builds a machine learning model that identifies customers likely to leave a bank, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn directly affects revenue. Acquiring a new customer costs significantly more than retaining an existing one — which makes prediction models extremely valuable.

This project:

✔ Cleans and preprocesses real-world banking data  
✔ Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
✔ Builds and evaluates classification models  
✔ Predicts whether a customer will exit (1) or stay (0)

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Banks struggle to identify customers who are about to leave. Traditional analysis fails because churn depends on multiple behavioral and financial factors.

**Goal:**  
Build a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn using historical data.

## 🗂 Dataset

**File:** `Churn_Modelling (AI).csv`

The dataset contains customer attributes such as:

- Credit Score  
- Geography  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Tenure  
- Balance  
- Number of Products  
- Has Credit Card  
- Is Active Member  
- Estimated Salary  

**Target Variable:**  
`Exited` →  
- `1` = Customer left  
- `0` = Customer stayed

## 🔥 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Importing Libraries
Used core Python ML stack:

- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Key steps:

✔ Removed unnecessary columns  
✔ Handled missing values  
✔ Encoded categorical variables  
✔ Scaled numerical features  

---

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Understanding the data before modeling prevents garbage predictions.
